## Group Project

### Acebook

Our first 2 week project was a real test in teamwork, communication and organisation, while learning how to use a new framework - Rails. Learning something brand new for us in a group was tricky but also very rewarding. We are all proud of our final product. We lost a day, thanks to the Easter bank holiday, so I think we acheieved a lot in the time we had.
- We implemented CI and CD with Circle CI and Heroku
- Added profile pictures to the app, with a default stock picture for new joiners
- Added likes using AJAX js and jQuery
