## Group Project

[MakersBnB](https://github.com/kjjwhitlock/makersbnb-ckaos)

A very different project to our usual afternoon pairing! This week is all about team work. We were split into teams of 5 and tasked to make a clone of AirBnB.

Learnt and applied a lot of new and useful skills, covering agile and XP methologies, planning and organisation, developer workflow using git and github and much more.

## Weekend Challenge

[Bowling Scorecard in Ruby](https://github.com/AJ8GH/bowling-challenge-ruby)

A move back to pure back end logic. It turns out bowling scoring is deceptively complex. In Ruby this was challenging but manageable - see my [README](https://github.com/AJ8GH/bowling-challenge-ruby) for more details on my approach. The real test will be in week 6's weekend challenge when we have to recreate the task in JavaScript after just one week of learning the language.
