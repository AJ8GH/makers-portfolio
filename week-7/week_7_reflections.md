## Weekend Challenge

### News-Summary-api

[News Summary API](https://github.com/AJ8GH/news-summary-challenge)

#### Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page. Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

##### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app. You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

And, as is the theme for this week, you won't use any libraries or frameworks!

But, feel free to use the test framework you wrote during the week!

##### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. http-server) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. You'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.

The API is hosted on an external server that you don't have to worry about. You only need a static web server. That's why this type of architecture is called "serverless".
