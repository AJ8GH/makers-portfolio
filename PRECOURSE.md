### Personal Projects

Around the Makers Precourse curriculum I also completed the following projects, to practise OOP, TDD, CI:
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/AJ8GH/blackjack) - Command line Blackjack game which has a real 52 card deck and official scoring & rules
- [Mastermind](https://github.com/AJ8GH/mastermind) - Command line game based on the board game Mastermind
- [Object Mart](https://github.com/AJ8GH/object-mart) - A supermarket checkout program which allows shoppers to pick items, see their prices, scan them in the checkout and see their total

### Reflection

I enjoyed immersing myself in the Makers precourse. The precourse is part-time, but I made the choice to dedicate my spare time to learning and improving in every aspect I could, focusing on testing using rspec, practicing TDD, applying OO design principles and picking up some html and CSS basics. I also learnt how to 'badge-up' my READMEs, becoming confident in setting up Travis CI, Coveralls and CodeClimate. The full-time course begins in 4 days (at the time of writing) and I can't wait!
