# Feedback

- don't always jump into trying to change someone's behaviour
- start with understanding them and where they are coming from.
- questions - why do you approach things in this way? genuinely wanting to understand

## Giving

### Why difficult
- don't want to hurt someone's feelings
- don't want to damage relationship
- empathy
- social awareness
- feels risky, not knowing how they can react

### Remember
- we are not responsible for other people's feelings and they are not responsible for ours
- you will give and receive feedback even when you don't ask for it
- often feedback will be delivered unskillfuly

## Receiving

### Why difficult
- never nice to hear less than perfect things about yourself
- can be emotional, espaecially if you already know something about yourself
- can be hard to hear feedback on something you've worked really hard on
- if you're having a bad day it can hurt

### Remember
- not everyone has high EQ - some people will not know your current mood, you need to communicate it to them
- extract the emotion from the situation

## Why is feedback so difficult?

it sits at the crux of our core needs:
- love & acceptance
- learning & growth

### 6 core human needs:
- love and connection
- significance - to feel valued
- certainty & security
- variety & a certain amount of uncertainty
- growth
- contribution

Feedback is everywhere - we receive it in different forms all the time

## Getting better at feedback

1. Shift your perspective
- there is no positive and negative feedback
  - we often think of feedback as either positive or negative
  - instead, view all feedback as neither positive or negative - all feedback is kind!
- feedback is kind!
  - even criticism has growth opportunities for you
  - reframe feedback in your mind
  - get excited about
- the receiver is the one with the power
  - they are the gate keeper and decide if they act on and implement it
  - be hungry for feedback, use it to learn and grow - it's free therapy, self growth gym!
  - reject feedback that is not valid only after considering it and not for emotional reasons

2. know thyself
- feedback triggers
  - truth - seems wrong or off target
  - relationship - something about our relationship with the person
  - identity - undermines how we see ourselves
- wrong spotting - looking for things that are wrong with the feedback, because if it's right we have to work on it and change our course
- blind spots - things we can't see about ourselves that others can
- build resilience - understand your profile
  - what's your happiness set point?
    - people higher on the scale do better with feedback and bounce back quicker
    - meditation is a great way to increase baseline happiness
  - swing - how wide do you swing?
    - people with low swing are even keeled
  - recovery and sustain
    - how long does it take for you to return to your baseline after something bad or good happens?
    - learn how long it normally takes for certain events / feelings
    - it's ok to feel how you feel

purpose of all is to help you grow and improve. all are important. no relationship can grow and improve without

## Make all feedback ASK

- actionable
  - avoid vague adjectives
  - give immediate steps that can be taken
  - facts and data, not stories
- specific
  - be clear about what the feedback is
  - give enough detail for them to understand it
- kind
  - the goal of feedback is for it to land and to get them on board
  - it's hard for people to take on feedback when dealing with emotional hurt from unkind comms
