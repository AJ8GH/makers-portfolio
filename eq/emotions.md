## emotion labelling

When feeling a strong or uncomfortable emotion, go into your body and spend 60 - 90 seconds labelling the emotion itself and the feelings and physical reactions it causes.

The alternative is:
- Suppression: which can cause, muscle tension, headaches, depression, frustration etc.
- Expression: moodswings, explosive outbursts
- Escape: excessive drugs, alcohol, gaming, even personal development work
