# Empathy

Empathy builds trust

Trust is the base of a high functioning team. without trust people don't feel safe to raise ideas and have debate. People need to feel someone has their back, need to feel safe around people.

## 3 types of empathy

### Affective empathy

Feeling emotionally with someone else

### Cognitive empathy

Consciously imagining how someone feels but not internalising the emotions

### Empathic concern

Consciously understanding _and_ internalising the emotions of another person.
